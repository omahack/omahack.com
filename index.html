    Omahack is a 24-hour hackathon in Omaha, NE, on April 7-8, 2023. We believe talented people often miss the opportunity to bump shoulders with others who compliment their skillsets and enable powerful teams and relationships. More details on the event location and schedule will be coming soon!

    <h1 class="section-header">More Questions and Answers...</h1>
    <h2>What's the cost?</h2>
    Admission and team participation is free and includes mentors, workshops, resources, and a great time!
    <h2>What's the schedule?</h2>
    Omahack will take place on April 7-8, 2023 (Friday to Saturday). Join the mailing list above for future updates.
    <h2>But I've never hacked before!</h2>
    That's okay! Hackathon teams need people with many skills — writers, artists, designers, and many others
    are always welcome to pitch their skills to a team.
    <h2>Have more questions?</h2>
    Contact us at <a href="mailto: omahackhq@gmail.com">omahackhq@gmail.com</a> with any other questions or concerns.
    <h2>Teams</h2>
    <h3>How do teams work?</h3>
    Teams will self-organize ahead of team registration using the Omahack Slack channel and the Omahack Github teams repository. This process will begin soon!
    <h3>What if I don't have a team?</h3>
    Don't worry! In addition to the team formation process described above, there will be a team formation opportunity immediately before the event begins where people can pitch ideas and team up.
    <h2>Mentors & Judges</h2>
    <h3>Can I volunteer to be a mentor?</h3>
    Of course! In addition to ambitious teams, we need mentors who can offer their skills and experience to teams
    and float around the event helping out as they can. Mentors can offer advice, product validation, and play
    the role of a potential first customer during the discovery and development process. Mentors should plan to be mingling
    and available while at the event and will be a key part of keeping the energy positive. Please contact us at
    <a href="mailto: omahackhq@gmail.com">omahackhq@gmail.com</a> if you're interested in learning more about
    volunteering as a mentor.
    <h3>Can I volunteer to be a judge?</h3>
    The judging panel will composed of Omaha community members, business leaders, and others in the Omaha startup
    ecosystem who can ask the "hard questions" following each pitch and help to select the most interesting and viable
    team projects at the end of the event. Please contact us at <a
      href="mailto: omahackhq@gmail.com">omahackhq@gmail.com</a> if you're interested in learning
    more about volunteering as a judge.

    <!-- <h2>Projects and Tracks</h2>
    <h3>What are Tracks?</h3>
    The Omahack tracks are problem areas defined to provide a starting point for teams to develop solutions for. Each
    track represents an important part of our local Omaha economy as well as an important piece of our global community.
    Teams must select at least one track to categorize their project under prior to their pitch at the completion of the
    hack phase. Projects can be submitted under more than one category. -->
    <h2>On Failure...</h2>
    <h3>Do I have to submit a project at the end of the hackathon?</h3>
    Yes! We understand not all project efforts end in success and that is the second best part about hackathons -- we fail fast and pivot! We strongly encourage everyone to pitch their team's results, lessons learned, and ideas for future attempts.

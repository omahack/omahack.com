    <h1>What?</h1>
    OMAHACK is hackathon series in Omaha, NE. We believe small teams can out-innovate large established organizations.
    We also believe talented people miss the opportunity to bump shoulders with others who compliment their skillsets
    and enable powerful teams and relationships. OMAHACK is taking place in January 2023. It is a multi-day
    hackathon event ending with a demo day and pitch to the community. The winning team gets the $1000 prize, with
    additional prizes to be announced.

    <h1>More Questions and Answers...</h1>
    <h2>What's the cost?</h2>
    Admission and team participation is free and includes mentors, workshops, resources, and a great time!
    <h2>What's the schedule?</h2>
    The schedule will be released closer to February 2023.
    <h2>But I've never hacked before!</h2>
    That's okay! We will have a beginner's workshop on getting started hacking if you're interested in development. But,
    teams need people with MANY skills — writers, artists, designers, musicians, and many others
    are always welcome to pitch their skills to a team.
    <h2>Have more questions?</h2>
    Contact us at <a href="mailto: omahackhq@gmail.com">omahackhq@gmail.com</a> with any other questions or concerns.
    <h2>Teams</h2>
    <h3>How do teams work?</h3>
    Teams can have up to 5 people. You can self-organize ahead of team registration using the OMAHACK Slack channel, the
    OMAHACK Github teams repository, or during the "team pitch" process where formed teams pitch their early ideas and
    potential team members pitch their skills and abilities.
    <h3>What if I don't have a team?</h3>
    Don't worry! We'll have a team formation event ahead of OMAHACK and a last-minute team formation event at the
    beginning of OMAHACK.
    <h2>Mentors & Judges</h2>
    <h3>Can I volunteer to be a mentor?</h3>
    Of course! In addition to ambitious teams, we need mentors who can offer their own skills and experience to teams
    and float around the event helping out as they can. Mentors can offer advice, product validation, and even play
    the role of a potential first customer during the ideation and discovery process. Mentors should plan to be mingling
    and available while at the event and will be a key part of keeping the energy positive. Please contact us at
    <a href="mailto: omahackhq@gmail.com">omahackhq@gmail.com</a> if you're interested in learning more about
    volunteering as a mentor.
    <h3>Can I volunteer to be a judge?</h3>
    The judging panel will composed of Omaha community members, business leaders, and others in the Omaha startup
    ecosystem who can ask the "hard questions" following each pitch and help to select the most interesting and viable
    team project at the end of the hackathon. Please contact us at <a
      href="mailto: omahackhq@gmail.com">omahackhq@gmail.com</a> if you're interested in learning
    more about volunteering as a judge.

    <h2>Projects and Tracks</h2>
    <h3>What are Tracks?</h3>
    The OMAHACK tracks are problem areas defined to provide a starting point for teams to develop solutions for. Each
    track represents an important part of our local Omaha economy as well as an important piece of our global community.
    Teams must select at least one track to categorize their project under prior to their pitch at the completion of the
    hack phase. Projects can be submitted under more than one category.
    <h3>Do I have to submit a project at the end of the hackathon?</h3>
    No. But, while we understand not all project efforts end in success, we strongly encourage everyone to pitch their
    team's results!

## What's the cost?

    Admission and team participation is free.

## What's the schedule?

    Omahack will take place on April 7-8, 2023 (Friday to Saturday). Join the mailing list above for future updates.

## Who can participate?

    Anyone who can contribute to the building of cool software can join! We generally like the <a href="https://github.com/github/hackathons/blob/main/TipsandTricks.md#who-are-these-people-and-whats-their-roles" target="_blank">GitHub hackathon roles</a> as a starting point:

      - Coder Your techies. Engineers and developers are your coders. They are the dev gurus and usually have good knowledge of many different tech stacks. A more technical focused hackathon might have multiple coders in the group, just like a product or service will have multiple developers working together.

      - Innovator: Your business and marketing people. They are the ones who validate ideas, understand the problem, research the market, and usually they'll be the one presenting the final product.
      
      - Designer: Your creative type. Every project needs great design, from beautiful UI to UX. These people focus on the product itself and how it looks and feels to the customer.

### Is GitHub required?

    Actually, yes. Team formation, hackathon announcements, and day-of information are just some of the important reasons we are asking all *official* communication and interaction happen in the GitHub arena. If you're not comfortable cloning, editing, and committing code repos, find yourself a team with at least one person comfortable doing so (although you'll still need a GitHub account on the team registration). Even better, brush up on the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world" target="_blank">GitHub Hello World</a> and level up!

## Teams

### How do teams work?

    Teams will self-organize using your own channels or the <a href="https://github.com/omahack/omahack.com/discussions/categories/teams" target="_blank">Omahack Teams discussion board</a>. Clone the <a href="https://github.com/omahack/omahack.com/blob/main/team-registration.md" target="_blank">Omahack.com repo</a> and update the registration markdown with your team's info.

### What if I don't have a team?

    Don't worry! Head over to the <a href="https://github.com/omahack/omahack.com/discussions/categories/teams" target="_blank">Omahack Teams discussion area on Github</a> and pitch your skill area or find a team with aligned needs!

## Mentors & Judges

### Can I volunteer to be a mentor?

    Of course! In addition to ambitious teams, we need mentors who can offer their skills and experience to teams
    and float around the event helping out as they can. Mentors can offer advice, product validation, and play
    the role of a potential first customer during the discovery and development process. Mentors should plan to be mingling
    and available while at the event and will be a key part of keeping the energy positive. Please contact us at
    <a href="mailto: omahackhq@gmail.com">omahackhq@gmail.com</a> if you're interested in learning more about
    volunteering as a mentor.

### Can I volunteer to be a judge?

    The judging panel will composed of Omaha community members, business leaders, and others in the Omaha startup
    ecosystem who can ask the "hard questions" following each pitch and help to select the most interesting and viable
    team projects at the end of the event. Please contact us at <a
      href="mailto: omahackhq@gmail.com">omahackhq@gmail.com</a> if you're interested in learning
    more about volunteering as a judge.

## On Failure

### Do I have to submit a project at the end of the hackathon?

    Yes! We understand not all project efforts end in success and that is the second best part about hackathons -- we fail fast and pivot! We strongly encourage everyone to pitch their team's results, lessons learned, and ideas for future attempts.
